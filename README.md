# Agent-Native Department Specification (ANDS)

## Overview

The Agent-Native Department Specification (ANDS) defines the minimum structure
for a persistent, machine-executable organizational unit composed of autonomous agents.

An Agent-Native Department (AND) replaces human-centric workflows with:

- Machine-executable task definitions
- Constraint-governed execution
- Full auditability and traceability

This specification focuses on execution semantics, not UI or vendor implementations.

---

## Positioning

ANDS is designed to function as:

- A reference model for enterprise AI execution
- A procurement-aligned specification
- A bridge between identity, execution, and compliance frameworks

---

## Relationship to AI Workforce Systems

This specification is developed in the context of AI Workforce systems,
but is not limited to any specific vendor or implementation.
